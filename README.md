## üöÄ Key Features

- **Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance:** Engineered an active scanning system using a servo-mounted ultrasonic sensor, achieving a **95% success rate** in navigating and avoiding obstacles in various test environments.
- **Hazard Detection & Response:** Integrated a dual-sensor system (flame and temperature) that achieved an **85% detection rate** in test conditions, automatically triggering a fan module to respond to the hazard.
- **Intelligent Navigation Logic:** The firmware implements a scan-and-decide algorithm where the robot stops upon detection, scans its left and right sides, and turns towards the direction with the most open space.
- **Modular C++ Code:** The firmware is written in C++ for the Arduino platform, featuring clearly defined functions for movement, sensor data acquisition, and decision-making, making it easy to read and maintain.
